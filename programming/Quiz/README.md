# DISCLAIMER
_The leaderboard, when two(+) people have the same score it comes up with an error.
to fix this i added a very small float to the end of each score so, if two people have the same score
it will be random on who is higher. if you know another way of doing it please open a pull request_
## Dependencies
1. You need a .txt in the same directory as your "main file"
2. Your .txt must be named " scores.txt " if you want to change it to something else you must also change the code
3. *Dont use both files, they both do the same thing*

## description
Full quiz, is a quiz on alan turing, but main feature is the fact it adds and pulls from a .txt
